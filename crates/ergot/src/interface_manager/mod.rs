//! The Interface Manager
//!
//! The [`NetStack`] is generic over a "Profile", which is how it handles
//! any external interfaces of the current program or device.
//!
//! Different profiles may support a various number of external
//! interfaces. The simplest profile is the "Null Profile",
//! Which supports no external interfaces, meaning that messages may only be
//! routed locally.
//!
//! The next simplest profile is one that only supports zero or one
//! active interfaces, for example if a device is directly connected to a PC
//! using USB. In this case, routing is again simple: if messages are not
//! intended for the local device, they should be routed out of the one external
//! interface. Similarly, if we support an interface, but it is not connected
//! (e.g. the USB cable is unplugged), all packets with external destinations
//! will fail to send.
//!
//! For more complex devices, a profile with multiple (bounded or
//! unbounded) interfaces, and more complex routing capabilities, may be
//! selected.
//!
//! Unlike Sockets, which might be various and diverse on all systems, a system
//! is expected to have one statically-known profile, which may
//! manage various and diverse interfaces.
//!
//! In general when sending a message, the [`NetStack`] will check if the
//! message is definitively for the local device (e.g. Net ID = 0, Node ID = 0),
//! and if not the NetStack will pass the message to the Interface Manager. If
//! the profile can route this packet, it informs the NetStack it has
//! done so. If the Interface Manager realizes that the packet is still for us
//! (e.g. matching a Net ID and Node ID of the local device), it may bounce the
//! message back to the NetStack to locally route.
//!
